docsight
==============

## About
Chrome extension for visualizing past visits to developer resources such as blog posts or Stack Overflow questions.

This enables two things:
1) A quick way to browse your history for recovering important development resources. 
2) An episodic timeline for reviewing your coding activities.  It is amazing what we can remember by viewing a history
of developer activities.

## Icon View
The view can be toggled between an icon cloud visualization or title view of your developement history.

## History Range
The default view shows the past 5 days.  Alternative date ranges include 1 month and 3 months.

## Filtering

docsight uses a whitelist approach for filtering visits to developer sites.  Adding own custom filtering is in development.
To filter google searches, only searches within the past 30 seconds of a developer site are included.
